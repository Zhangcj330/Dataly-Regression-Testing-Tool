I teach a number of different classes all relating to healing within (your energy) the Metaphysical world of Frequencies. I love travelling, I love travellers and although I am now at the point that I need to ground myself and am able to more fully root my life here on the coast. \\n\\nI enjoy Airbnb because it gives me a chance to hang out with travellers and give other travellers a nice place to crash here while in town thats not a hostel or hotel. :) no matter if we meet or not <3 I hope you enjoy your stay here in Seattle.

Born and raised in Kansas city, Mo. Spiritual - Creative - Vegan - Psychic - Adventurer - Seeker - Intuitive Healer.\\r\\nOrganic Gardener - Organic Farmer - Artist - Chef - Writer - Photographer - Skateboarder - Traveller. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the 3rd year Ive been here on the coast pursuing my Jewelry career. I teach a number of different classes all relating to healing within (your energy) the Metaphysical world of Frequencies. I love travelling, I love travellers and although I am now at the point that I need to ground myself and am able to more fully root my life here on the coast. \\r\\n\\r\\nI enjoy Airbnb because it gives me a chance to hang out with travellers and give other travellers a nice place to crash here while in town thats not a hostel or hotel. :) no matter if we meet or not <3 I hope you enjoy your stay here in Seattle.

I'm Brant and I live in the Capital Hill area of Seattle. I'm a professional in the medical field and I work at a downtown hospital here in Seattle.\\n\\nMy town home is newly constructed and in the Capital Hill area of Seattle. In my opinion Capital Hill is the best place in all of Seattle to get the truest feel of what the city is all about. I will be your attentive host throughout your stay. The home has two Airbnb bedrooms, both on the lower floors of my home which share a private rear entrance of their own and a bathroom. The upper room may also use the front door entrance for access to their room. The modern decor fits beautifully with the neighborhood and the neighbors are all very polite.\\n\\nMy home is located just one block from Seattle University and is within a 5 minute walk to the trendiest restaurants, cocktail bars, and clubs Capital Hill has to offer. Seattle is an extremely walkable city and the home is also within a 25-30 minute walk to Downtown Seattle and Pike Place Market. The home is tucked away on a quiet street so if you want to escape from the hustle and bustle of downtown and Capital Hills (Pike and Pine triangle) just head on over and relax after a long day of sight seeing, shopping, or after a late night out.

I also helped a good friend get his place set up for it as well and really enjoyed the process and meeting so many wonderful people.  I knew I would soon follow and here I am. \\n\\nMy favorite things are travel stories, food and wine with friends...especially gathered together cooking in the kitchen and a new found love of hot yoga.  I have traveled extensively and can never get enough of it. Professionally, I am a full time decorative mural artist. I paint everything from children's rooms to wine cellars for residential and commercial clientele since 2002.\\n\\nAs a host, I can either give you your complete privacy or I can help with recommendations and enjoy a morning visit over coffee or an evening glass of wine.

I also helped a good friend get his place set up for it as well and really enjoyed the process and meeting so many wonderful people.  I knew I would soon follow and here I am. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy favorite things are travel stories, food and wine with friends...especially gathered together cooking in the kitchen and a new found love of hot yoga.

The cascades are my home, and the Seattle-area is a wonderful place to come home to after exploring other parts. In 2013 I spent 5 months rolling across the US playing music and writing software.\\n\\nAs a host, I would love to give you my 'insider' take on Seattle and point you in the right direction according to your interests.

I enjoy reading, gardening, spending time with my family and friends and have created a great life balance for myself.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy life motto, stay in the moment and appreciate each moment for what that moment brings.   Each person who stays at my home, gives me an opportunity to connect more with the world around me.\\r\\n\\r\\n      1\n",

I am now completely out of sports and I am using that time to travel around for new experiences. \\r\\n     I'm extremely outgoing and I love meeting new people. I grew up a military brat and a saggitarius. Finding new places to explore will be a path of mine until I pass away.\\r\\n     If you want to know anything else, just ask me! \\r\\n     -Dereck\n",
